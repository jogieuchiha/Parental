Created in a 5-person team to create a 2-Dimensional shooting platform game created using the game engine Godot.
Player 1 plays as a lost child exploring an apocalyptic world looking for his father. 
Player 1 can walk around, jump, shoot enemies and has a built-in recoil function for every time the gun is shot.
Responsible for the backend proportion of the game, responsible for AI movements, AI interaction (Alive and Death Functions), and stage layouts.
Helped on debugging after beta test and alpha testing.
